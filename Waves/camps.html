    <h2>Camps</h2>

    <p>Exclusively available at WAVES, our seasonal Surf Camps are perfect for kids and teens aged 5 to 17. We’ve been operating since 2002, and our intensive half-day or full-day surf school sessions help students build confidence and improve their skills quickly.</p>

    <p class="note">OUR SPRING AND SUMMER SURF CAMP AND CALIFORNIA SURF SCHOOL IS A GREAT WAY FOR KIDS AND TEENS TO LEARN OCEAN SAFETY WHILE HAVING FUN SURFING!</p>

    <h3>Here’s how Surf Camp works:</h3>

    <p><strong>Choose your session:</strong> Spring Break (March-April) or Summer Break (June-September)</p>

    <p><strong>Choose your duration:</strong> We offer <strong>full-day</strong> (9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) and <strong>half-day</strong> (9:30 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., or 12:45 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.) sessions.</p>

    <p><strong>Take advantage of our flexible scheduling:</strong> Sign up for as many or as few half days, full days, or weeks as you like.</p>
