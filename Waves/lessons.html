    <div id="privatePackage">
        <h3>Private Packages</h3>
        <p>Or, for a more thorough introduction to surfing, our Private Surf Lesson Packages might be more suited to your needs. In successive lessons, our students learn how to turn, how to read and select waves, techniques to paddle out through the break, how to best maneuver the board, timing, etiquette, tides and other factors affecting wave quality, and more.</p>

        <p>In general, most people get a solid basic intro in a <strong>3-lesson package</strong>, and are able to consistently catch waves and stand on their own. In a <strong>5-lesson package</strong>, most are able to turn fairly consistently after catching a wave. After a <strong>7-lesson package</strong>, many are able to identify a ride able open-face wave, and have moderate success at maneuvering themselves into position to catch it. Let us help you take your surfing to the next level!</p>
