    <h1 style="text-align: center">Welcome to WAVES</h1>
    <p>Ever thought of picking up a surf board and paddling out to ocean instead of just laying in the sun? Well, think about it no more. Take the first steps! <a href="aboutUs.html">WAVES</a> offers a wide variety of options for you to start your journey.</p>

    <h3>Lessons</h3>
    <p>If you're looking to just dip your toes in and figure out how to stand up on the boards then our <a href="lessons.html#privateLessons">Private Lessons</a> will be perfect for you.</p>

    <p>If you're wanting to go a step further and earn that beach sticker on the back of your car then our <a href="lessons.html#privatePackage">Private Packages</a> are right up your alley. They come in a variety of sizes from three lessons to seven.</p>

    <p>Well, what if you're just looking to have a little fun with your friends while learning a little bit about surfing at the same time? Then our beginner <a href="lessons.html#groupLessons">Group Lessons</a> are what you are looking for!</p>

    <p>But what if you already have some experience surfing and you're wanting to learn from the instructors <em>and</em> other surfers? Well, may we re-introduce you to our <a href="lessons.html#groupLessons">Group Lessons</a>, but this time they are our Master Level lessons.</p>

    <h3>Camps</h3>
    <p>Lastly, if you're looking to get the most out of the warm weather while we have it, check out our <a href="camps.html">Camps</a>. They provide you an intense experience that tries to jam as much surfing knowledge into you as quickly as possible (and hopefully it lasts)!</p>
