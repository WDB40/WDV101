        <h1>Wind Energy</h1>
        <h3>The energy generated by the air moving kind of fast.</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Wind energy</strong> is typically generated at wind farms from the use of <em><strong>wind turbines</strong></em>.
            The state of Iowa has several different wind farms scattered around throughout the state.
            While Iowa is flat and makes for easy construction of the wind turbines, <em>mountain ridges</em> are known to have wind turbines as well.
            The mountains near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba are lined with a series of wind turbines that create wind energy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Wind energy is one of the green alternatives for energy. Many would like to see the use of wind turbines take over the power industry as
            the world moves away from energy sources such as coal. But that may not be feasible for a while. Compared to other energy sources like coal,
            the energy produced is not as reliable as coal since it relies on the wind the actually be blowing.
        </p>

        <p>
            But there are still positives to the use of wind energy being a new and growing area. Continuing the coal comparison, the jobs in that industry have
            been declining for years as society pivots away from the use of that energy source. This has a lot to do with the safety and environmental factors of
            producing energy from that source. With the growing demand for wind energy and other green sources, the job prospects in those areas will only continue to rise.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the wind energy industry grows, Iowa's involvement will grow. With the topography of Iowa, it is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this
            evolving industry. The flat land of Iowa not only provides land that is easy to construct the massive wind turbines on, but it also also for strong wind flow.
            States such as West Virginia (which is struggling with the mining of coal), the construction of wind turbines is not as ideal. The mountains of the state make
            the construction much harder and they reduce the power of the wind as well.

        <p><em>&ldquo;Iowa derives a greater percentage of its electricity from wind than any other state, and we’re second in the nation in the number of people employed in the wind industry. Thanks to our low electricity prices and commitment to renewable energy, major tech companies and other energy-intensive businesses are interested in locating and expanding facilities here, which is good economic news for all Iowans.&rdquo;</em></p>
