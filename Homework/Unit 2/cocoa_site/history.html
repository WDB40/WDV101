        <h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>

        <h3>Grown Far from Its Roots</h3>
        <p>
            While the cacao tree, where we get these beans, is native to the Amazon Basin in South America. Today, nearly
            <strong>70%</strong> of the beans are grown in West Africa.
        </p>

        <h3>Older Than the Roman Empire</h3>
        <p>There is evidence in pottery at an archaeology site in Puerto Escondido in Honduras that
            suggests that products made of cocoa beans were first produced and consumed between <strong>1500 and 1400</strong> BC.
            This means that despite the popularity of the <span class="standout">Hershey</span> chocolate bar, it probably wasn't
            the first chocolate bar made.
        </p>

        <h3>Leche con Chocolate</h3>
        <p>Even though in 1400 BC, the people of Honduras were enjoying their chocolate, it didn't
            become popular in Europe until the mid-17th century after it was introduced
            to Europe by the Spaniards. And they weren't shoveling it down as chocolate bars. During this
            time, they preferred their chocolate as a <em>beverage</em>.
