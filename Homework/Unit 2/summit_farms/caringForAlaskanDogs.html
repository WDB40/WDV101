    <section>
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Type of Home</h2>
        <p>We've separated out the Do's and Don'ts of Alaskan dog homes.</p>
        <h4 class="listTitle">Do</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Live on a colder climate (like, you know, Alaska)</li>
            <li>Live in your own home</li>
            <li>Have a large yard</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="listTitle">Don't</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Live near the equator.</li>
            <li>Live in a tiny apartment</li>
            <li>Live in someone else's home (it's inevitable that the pup will eat something)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Activities</h2>
        <p>These dogs can be very active dogs, so burning as much of their energy as possible is definitely something that you want to consider.</p>
        <p>Below are some activities that you should regularly do with your dog in order to keep him happy (and sane):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Daily walks</li>
            <li>Trip to the dog park on weekends</li>
            <li>Play with them and their toys in the house</li>
            <li>Take them with you when you run</li>
            <li>Hikes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a note, do not leave them in a cage for more than a couple hours. This could lead to some bad results.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Grooming</h2>
        <p>A lot of people know about these dogs because of their beautiful fur. You will need to do a bit of maintenance to keep it in the best condition and to keep your dog health.</p>
        <p>We recommend the standard of brushing the dog at least once or twice a week to keep all of that old fur off of them. If the build of old hair becomes too much, it can overheat the dog.</p>
        <p>In addition to that standard, there will be two times during the year where they will heavily shed their fur. During this time, you will need to brush a little more than normal to keep your dog comfortable, happy, and healthy.</p>
