        <p>Bert and Ernie are two new born puppies! Only 7 weeks old!</p>
        <p>While two look like brothers, they actually are not. But since birth the two have been inseparable, so we are only offering them to a home that with take <strong>both</strong>.</p>
        <p>Due to their age, they are not quite ready to go home yet. We will need to wait until they are 10 weeks old.</p>
        <p>Neither pup as had their shots yet and this will need to be taken care of by the future owner as soon as possible.</p>
