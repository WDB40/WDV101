    <section>
        <p>Below are some key tidbits about our Alaskan dogs that any person looking to own should know before considering purchasing or adoption one.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Environment</h2>
        <p>These dogs are made for the cold. If you are planning to take this dog to a state like Florida, that would be extremely unwise. Please make sure that the climate in your area is suitable for this type of dog before you take responsibility for one.</p>
        <p>These dogs like to be out in the out in the fresh, cold air as much as possible. They are active breeds and will go crazy if they are stuck inside all day. If you are living in an apartment now and plan to be there for the foreseeable future, do not take ownership of this type of dog.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Temperament</h2>
        <p>These dogs will be extremely loving, loyal, protective, and playful.</p>
        <p>In the home, these dogs will work well with almost any family (as long as they have the space to run). They are extremely affectionate and are quite friendly with kids. They love to play, so have a ball around is always a must.</p>
        <p>When it comes to people and animals outside of the home, that doesn't always go as smoothly. They are territorial, so if you encroach on their space, they might be inclined to bark and snap back (for both people and animals).</p>
        <p>But if approached in the proper way, these dogs can be extremely friendly with strangers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Health</h2>
        <p>As mentioned in the environment section, one of the biggest threats to this type of dogs health can be the climate itself. If the dog is not in the right temperature environment, there will be noticeable differences in their habits and activities.</p>
        <p>But in general, these dogs are about average when it comes to health concerns. They are not the best when it comes to long, healthy lives, but they are not the worst.</p>
